      THE CONTINUOUS FIGHT AGAINST BLACK INJUSTICE

      Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political movement advocating for a world where Black lives are not intentionally targeted and violated against. The Black Lives Matter Movement is not, and should not be seen as, a trend. It is an ongoing and necessary dedication to fighting the racial injustice Black people have to face in their daily lives. While generations of civil rights activism have created more opportunities and gains for Black people in the political, social, and economical sense, our country is still plagued by a system of racial injustice and has yet to break away from its roots of racial inequity against the Black community. It is important to understand that the fight against Black injustice is still very prevalent in our lives today. We need to continue to support and advocate for Black rights and continue to revolt against the system that is and has been restricting Black people from liberty, justice, and freedom.
